Final product:

		price should be chosen based on likelyhood of being bought
	shows games that should have their card pack bought/sold
	
TODO:
 - filter out items in inventory that are not trading cards
 - place data in spreadsheet

	- also get how many sales took place in last 24 hours
 - get complete card pack information for games
