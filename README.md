# SteamCardTrader
An application that will help decide whether to buy or sell trading cards on steam

Right now this application automatically looks up my steamID, but you can change that field to any valid steamID.
So long as that user does not have their profile set to private, the script can pull up and work with their inventory.

Keep in mind that this program does not guarentee that any item will have a price associated with it.
If the excel file is not generated within the same folder as the script, it is probably because every single price check failed.
